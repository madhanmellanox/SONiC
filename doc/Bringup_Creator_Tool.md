Bringup Creator Tool
====================
Bringup  Creator is a python based tool that is used to generate the files required for bringing up a Mellanox Spectrum based platform (switch). There are certain files created as part of default SKU folder and there are few files that are created for the entire platform irrespective of the SKU and they are placed outside the SKU folders. 

The common files that are placed outside the SKU folders are:
* default_sku
* pcie.yaml
* platform.json (generated using Vadymâ€™s script)
* platform_components.json
* platform_reboot
* platform_wait
* pmon_daemon_control.json
* port_peripher_config.j2
* sensors.conf
* system_health_monitoring_config.json
* thermal_policy.json

The files that are part of plugins folder are:
* eeprom.py
* fanutil.py
* psuutil.py
* sfplpmget.py
* sfplpmset.py
* sfpreset.py
* sfputil.py

The files that are part of (default) sku folder are:
* buffers.json.j2
* buffers_defaults_t0.j2
* buffers_defaults_t1.j2
* buffers_dynamic.json.j2
* hwsku.json
* pg_profile_lookup.ini
* port_config.ini
* qos.json.j2
* sai.profile
* sai_xxx.xml

# bringup_gen CLI

bringup_gen CLI is a simple CLI which takes an input folder where the input files that are required to generate the bringup related files for that platform. The usage of bringup_gen CLI is shown below:

madhan@arc-build-server:/builds2/madhan/bringup_tool$ sudo ./bringup_gen.py -h
usage: bringup_gen.py [-h] [-v] [-i INPUT]

Generate files for Bringing up a platform

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Input folder containing files that are input for Bringup tool

The tool generates all the files required for bring up and saves them in an output folder similar to that folder for the platform on the switch say, x86_64-mlnx_msn3700-r0 and on the switch it will be placed in /usr/share/device/mellanox/x86_64-mlnx_msn3700-r0/

If there are any files missing in the input folder, we will skip the generation of files that require the particular input file, but will proceed to generate other files whose input files exist in the input folder.

# Input files

The following are the input files that are required to generate files for bring up of a platform.
* sai_platform_info.xls
* buffer_spectrum.xls
* platfom.json
* platform_info.xml

sai_platform_info.xls file is the file that contains SAI port related information like local port, SDK/SAI port, module, lanes etc. This is a file which is obtained from the FW team.

buffer_spectrum.xls file is the file that contains QOS related values for all kinds of Spectrum ASICs. This file is input for all QOS related files that are required for bringup. This file is obtained from Architecture team.

platform.json file is one of the required files for Bringup and it serves as an input file also here. There is already a script file to generate platform.json per platform

platform_info.xml is the input files which contains required information for generating several output files required for bringup. An example of fields is breakout mode and port speed for generating SAI_xxx.xml file.
Since platform_info.xml file contains required fields for multiple files, the content of the platform_info.xml file is shown below.
